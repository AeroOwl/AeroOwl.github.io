I'm a computer and information security researcher and an second-year Master student.

My research interests traverse on these topics:

* Back-and-forth program analysis
    - dependency and alias relationship
    - sanbox containment
    - adversarial learning against av engines
    
* Textual threat spotting
    - Rumor propagation and fact-checking
    - Prioritizing, pruning and zooming of graph representation
